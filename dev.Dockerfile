# Dockerfile for building container for the Items REST API backend server.

# NODE_IMAGE is passed when building the container. That way we don't hardcode
# the image or its version that this container is based on.

# /app will hold our application. Create it and make it our working directory.
WORKDIR /src

# Install dependencies.
COPY ./src/package.json ./src/yarn.lock ./

# Best practice: Don't run as root. Instead run as node (created in node image)
RUN chown -R node:node .

# EXPOSE 3000

# # Setting NODE_ENV to production improves efficiencies.
# # During development, override by passing a development when running
# # the container. E.g., docker run -e NODE_ENV=development ...
# ENV NODE_ENV=production

# # When ran, call node on index.js.
# CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]

# # Install our server code.
