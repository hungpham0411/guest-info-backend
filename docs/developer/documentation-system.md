# Documentation System

OpenAPI specification

* [The Swagger Viewer extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer)
  renders the specification locally.
* GitLab will provide a rendered view of the specification if the file
  is named openapi.yaml.

Client and Developer Guides

* Written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* Rendered and browsed in GitLab
* Each devtool has a `README.md` which is the entrypoint
to its documentation.
* Similar to devtools, each sub-component has a `README.md`
which is the entrypoint to its documentation.
